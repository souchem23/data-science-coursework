In the Wembanyama example, we may have available data that describes how the audience supports Wembanyama or how many people attended the game. However, these data points would not be useful in determining whether Wembanyama would make his next shots or not. In fact, more relevant data like the number of times he bounces the basketball may also skew the data as a correlation/causation between the number of times the ball is bounced and shots scored may not exist. This would skew the data and introduce an inaccurate model that came due to too much information."

For example, the context can be based off of certain observations or even specific generalizations from the past: Wembanyama's shots in the EuroLeague was the context of the Unit 2 notes. However, this context can even be certain opinions like \"I know that Wembanyama has a nince shooting form and has a betteer form than others so he will find a high free thro percentage and we can represent this in a specific distribtuion.\". This context then informs the assumptions that are made with prior. These priors are both the context and assumptions can be used to make predictions that follow logic. The assumptions and the context, or the assumptions and the previous evidence, inform the prior. the prior are used to make confident predcitions and it is the way to turn our assumptions into predictions.

The likelihood refers to what is actually happening and what is about to happen. The prior referred to the past assumptions, but the likelihood is based on what is going to occur in real life. The likelihood refers to the percentage that our final prediction will be correct, especially since it based on real observations. The  likelihood relates to the assumptions because we can choose to include and exclude certain data as a part of the likelihood. For example, in the Wembanyama example, we can choose to make assumptions about the nature of the league. If we assumed that the EuroLeague was similar to the NBA, then we could choose to include data from the EuroLeague into our likelihood. These assumptions are informed by the context. The context that you choose to have about the nature of the EuroLeague and the NBA informs our likelihood and is based on our assumptions. Also, the way that we define our likelihood refers to our context. We can take a variety of perspectives to view the same data, or reality, which is also informed by our context and assumptions. Finally, we can use all of the data that we have gathered to create a distribution that can inform our predictions. Having observations allows one to make predictions that include observed data and evidence."
